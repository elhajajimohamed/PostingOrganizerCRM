/**
 * ACCEPTANCE TEST SPECIFICATIONS
 * Enhanced Scheduling System
 *
 * This document outlines the comprehensive test suite that must be implemented
 * to verify all features mentioned in the requirements. Each test case represents
 * a critical acceptance criterion that must pass for the system to be considered
 * fully functional.
 *
 * TEST CATEGORIES:
 * 1. Cross-account group awareness (global group state)
 * 2. Import behavior (idempotent, safe)
 * 3. Ramp-up for newly added groups
 * 4. Variable media & text variants support
 * 5. Duplicate-content prevention (cross-account)
 * 6. Scheduling algorithm adjustments
 * 7. Atomic claiming / concurrency
 * 8. Notification logic
 * 9. Operator controls & UI hooks
 * 10. Config knobs (expose to admin)
 * 11. Cross-account group test
 * 12. Import idempotency
 * 13. Duplicate-prevention
 * 14. Concurrency
 *
 * SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Jest testing framework with Firebase mocking
 * - Test database with proper cleanup
 * - Mock services for external dependencies
 * - Test data factories for consistent test data
 *
 * EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
 * - Node.js test environment
 * - Firebase emulator for database tests
 * - Proper async/await handling
 * - Transaction rollback after each test

/**
 * TEST EXECUTION CHECKLIST
 *
 * Before running tests, ensure:
 * 1. Firebase project is configured for testing
 * 2. Firebase emulator is running (or use test database)
 * 3. All dependencies are installed
 * 4. Test environment variables are set
 * 5. Mock services are properly configured
 *
 * TEST CATEGORIES BY PRIORITY:
 * - Critical: Must pass for system to be functional
 * - High: Important for core functionality
 * - Medium: Enhances user experience
 * - Low: Nice to have, edge cases
 *
 * PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
 * - All critical tests should complete in < 30 seconds
 * - Database operations should not deadlock
 * - Memory usage should remain stable during test runs
 * - Concurrent operations should not cause race conditions
 *
 * COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS:
 * - All critical and high priority tests must have test implementations
 * - Each acceptance criterion must have corresponding test case
 * - Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
 * - Integration between services must be verified
